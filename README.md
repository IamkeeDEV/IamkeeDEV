## About me 🔎
I am interested in code and designing so I signed up for GitHub to learn more (and maybe make something!)

## Interested/Working on ‼️
- Working on a fork I made of 0x5abe's PlatformerSaves that ports the mod into the latest version of Geometry Dash. You can see that by clicking [here](https://github.com/IamkeeDEV/PlatformerSaves2.207) or viewing my pins.

## Currently learning 🏫
- Learning BatchScript [.bat] (Beginner)
- Learning Visual Basic Script [.vbs] (Beginner)
- Learning Lua [Primarily Roblox Lua] (Decent knowledge)

## Fun fact 💡
Even though I joined GitHub in Early 2022, I actually started in 2024 since I did not do anything until late 2024.

## A big favor 🎁
If you have any tips for GitHub, it would be nice to let me know about it since I am still very much new to this.
