## About me 🔎
I am interested in code and designing so I signed up for GitHub to learn more (and maybe make something!)

## Interested/Working on ‼️
Working on a fork I made of 0x5abe's PlatformerSaves that ports the mod into the latest version of Geometry Dash.

## Currently learning 🏫
I am trying to learn BatchCode, I know the basics like echo but more complicated stuff I do not know yet.

## Extra 🎁
If you have any tips for GitHub, it would be nice to let me know about it since I am still very much new to this.
